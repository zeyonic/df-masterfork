[TEXT_SET:GREET_REPLY_DIFF_LANGUAGE]

Hello, [AUDIENCE:RACE].  I am [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME].

Are you enjoying your stay here?  My name is [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME].
Be grateful I know enough words to say my name is [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME].
Have you tried the food?  Just say [SPEAKER:FIRST_NAME] sent you.
Here comes the [AUDIENCE:RACE].  Call me [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME].
I never thought I'd meet a [AUDIENCE:RACE] like this.  I am [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME].
Just call me [SPEAKER:FIRST_NAME], [AUDIENCE:RACE].  I do not want to hear you butcher the tongue of my people.
My name is [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME], which means [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME] in your tongue.
My name is [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME].  Say it right, [AUDIENCE:RACE].
Pray tell, [AUDIENCE:RACE].  This is [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME].
State your peace, [AUDIENCE:RACE].  I'm [SPEAKER:FIRST_NAME].

You certainly sound like a [AUDIENCE:RACE]. I am [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME].
You look like you've never seen a [SPEAKER:RACE] before. My name is [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME].
Your command of my mother tongue is... admirable. Let's just say I'm [SPEAKER:FIRST_NAME].
[AUDIENCE:FIRST_NAME] what?  Pray forgive my difficulties, though I imagine you would struggle with [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME] yourself.
[AUDIENCE:FIRST_NAME] has an exotic ring to it.  Mine is [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME].

Out of my way.  [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME] doesn't talk to your kind.
Speak slower, [AUDIENCE:RACE].  I can barely understand you.
Welcome to [CONTEXT:PLACE:TRANS_NAME].  I'm [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME].
Well!  What brings a [AUDIENCE:RACE] all the way here?
