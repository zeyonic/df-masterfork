[OBJECT:TEXT_SET]

[TEXT_SET:CURSE]

Who dares to enter my house?  I curse you!

Oh, what arrogance you display, what hubris!
If anything will be left to curse, your name will be cursed for all eternity to follow!
And you would take this rest away from us, from all [SPEAKER:RACE]kind? You disgust me.
You will perish from the horror your own curiosity shall unleash upon you.
It will all end here soon enough, one way or another.
You shall be the end of it, the cruellest [AUDIENCE:RACE] in all history.
You would unleash pandemonium, out of vain hope?
In your ignorance, you have created suffering and sin!
You will only heal when you have atoned for your crime!

Who dares awaken me, [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME], who has defeated death itself?
Who dares to trot on my lair's floor? Who dares to test my patience?
A malediction for you, foolish [AUDIENCE:RACE]!
May the grass underneath your feet die, and the sun never shine on your ignorant self!
May our souls be eternally damned!
Another insolent [AUDIENCE:RACE], who dares to walk on my grave, even as bones crunch under [AUDIENCE:PRO_POS] feet?
I damn you, [AUDIENCE:RACE], I damn you to your death!
Your life is forfeit and your soul is mine!
And you do not know who I am? I, [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME], spite you to oblivion!
May your body turn to dust on your feet, and your name be forgotten by everyone you hold dear!

Aw, damn, what are you doing in here? You know, I'm gonna have to curse you now.
What manner of mortal being dares disturb my slumber? Begone, and may my curse ever dog your steps!
May the souls of all who have entered here be eternally plagued by the malediction of [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME]!
After ten thousand years, I am free at last! The hour of my triumph is at hand!
What foul vermin disgraces my stately sanctum? I bite my thumb at you, vile knave, and my spite shall hang as an iron mantle.
Despair, for in entering this noble tomb you have crossed the eternal [SPEAKER:TRANS_NAME], and now my curse shall ever rest upon your shoulders!

They have made a mistake in sending you, [AUDIENCE:RACE].
There is no medicine which will cure you of me!
You are far too arrogant - it weakens you. You shall die in this place.
I shall rend the flesh from your body while you still breathe!
Go now! You are banished from this place!
Despair now, [AUDIENCE:RACE]. The gods cannot help you.
Call upon your precious guardian, [AUDIENCE:RACE]. It shall not avail you.
The time of your death draws near.
Your life belongs to me now!
You shall pay for your insolence!
You are but a godless void!

Become as you behold...
Foolishness, [AUDIENCE:RACE]. Foolishness.
Eternal darkness comes unto you!
Every light must fade, every heart return to darkness!
Sleep with this trauma that will leave you sleepless!
You dare bring light into my lair? You must die!
